        <h3>Dragonmaster</h3>
        <p><strong>Dragonmaster:</strong> The Dragonai tribe have lived in the Himalayas for centuries,
                    and rarely leave their mountains often. As an exception, however, Dragonai who
                    have bonded well with a particular dragon and show great skill in fighting depart
                    from their home and go in search of great legends to fight, only to
                    become legends themselves, the Dragonmasters.<br />They usually bond with one of five
                    particular dragons:<br />
