<h3>Valkyrie</h3>
<img src = 'static/pictures/Valkyrie.jpg'>
<p><strong>Valkyrie:</strong> Strong and wild, their victory cries echo throughout the skies
            and bring hope into the hearts of the innocent and fear into the hearts of the
            unholy. All Valkyrie's gather at Yggdrasil for leisure, and Asgard for times of war.
            The unworthy or fallen members of Valkyrie are sent to Ginnungagap, a primordial void, 
            filled with mists, that exists between Niflheim and Muspelheim. The most worthy join
            a group of maidens who serve the god Odin and are sent by him to the battlefields 
            to choose the slain who were worthy of a place in Valhalla. They treat their winged 
            horses as family and talk to them as if they were human. 
            Merciless and savage, yet beautiful.</p>
